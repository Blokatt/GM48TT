# Huh?

GM48TT(or GM48 Time-Lapse Tool) is a teeny-tiny tool that automatically captures screenshots at a given interval.
It's designed for GameMaker: Studio users, as it can automatically detect presence of its instance and automatically starts capturing.

GM48TT is written in C# .NET 4.5 and should serve as a nice example of how NOT to organise code, as most of is contained within the Form1.cs class.
