# Huh?

GM48TT (or gm(48) Time-Lapse Tool) is a teeny-tiny Windows application that automatically captures screenshots at a given time interval.
It's designed for GameMaker: Studio users, as it can automatically detect presence of its instance in the system, in which case
it automatically starts capturing.

GM48TT is written in C# .NET 4.5 and should serve as a nice example of how NOT to organise code, as most of is contained within the main form class.
